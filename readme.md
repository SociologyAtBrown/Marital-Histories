I use data from three rounds of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) to demonstrate how to:

(1) Create person time data in Stata; 
(2) Code time-varying covariates;
(3) Visualize event history data; and 
(3) Conduct discrete time multi-nomial logistic regression analysis. 

The codes are from a paper I published in 2014 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4800999/).
