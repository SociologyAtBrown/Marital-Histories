I use data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DSHS) to demonstrate how to:

(1) Create person time data in Stata; 
(2) How to code time-varying covariates; and 
(3) How to run discrete time multi-nomial logistic regression. 

The ananlysis is from a paper I published in 2014 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4800999/).
